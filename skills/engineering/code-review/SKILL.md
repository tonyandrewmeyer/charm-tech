# Canonical Code Review Guidelines

These guidelines define how code reviews should be conducted at Canonical. They focus on broadly applicable review techniques that are relevant to all projects.

---

## Soft Skills

### Tone
- Review the **submission**, not the author. Avoid "you did this wrong."
- Prefer "this could be improved by…" or "this doesn't seem right to me…"
- Be **constructive** — suggest how something may be improved
- For non-critical suggestions, make clear it's informational, not a change request: "I might have done this differently for these reasons…"
- Avoid being overtly negative, even if something is poor quality
- Remember: review is a **learning experience** for both author and reviewers

### Label comments by intent
Prefix each comment with its intent so the author can tell blocking issues from
optional ones at a glance (see [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/)):
- `blocking:` — must be resolved before merge
- `suggestion:` — a proposed improvement; the author decides
- `nit:` — minor/stylistic; non-blocking by definition
- `question:` — seeking clarification, not necessarily a change
- `praise:` — call out something done well
Add `(non-blocking)` to any label when the distinction isn't obvious from the prefix.

## Procedures

- If **CI isn't passing**, investigate why before approving
- Commits/PRs should **reference their tracking ticket** where one exists (e.g. a link to the issue)
- Pull request descriptions must be **usefully descriptive** — "Fixed Bug 12345" is not sufficient; include a sentence or two about what changed and why

---

## Code Quality

- All patches must follow the **code style and conventions** of the appropriate project
- Look for cases where end-user function behaviour **diverges from upstream** — ask for clarification and push for upstreamable implementations

---

## Changeset Size and Scope

### Size
- Large changesets are complex and difficult to review
- Large changesets can usually be **split** into smaller commits or separate tickets
- They tend to combine related but not strictly connected changes
- Use pragmatism — sometimes a large changeset is genuinely necessary
- When a changeset is too large, still review it in full, but **recommend splitting** it (a `suggestion:`, not a blocker) — note where the natural seams are

### Scope
- Does it address things **not needed** in the ticket? Call them out — good changes can go in a separate commit/ticket
- Does it address things **not mentioned** in the commit message?
- Does it make unintentional changes that might cause bugs?

### Completeness
- Watch for **missing files** (forgot to `git add`)
- Missing files do not always cause CI failures (e.g. a comment referencing a README that was not committed)

## Recommended Review Process

1. **Read the ticket(s)** — understand what should be done, verify referenced tickets are correct
2. **Skim** commit messages and code for formatting, size, and scope issues
3. **Dive deeper**:
   - Check **leaf functions** first (no calls to other modified functions)
   - Work upward toward functions with more modified invocations
4. **Walk through** new control flow, computational, or memory mapping behaviour — consider optimisation opportunities, especially on hot paths
