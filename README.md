# Charm Tech

Shared standards, conventions, and templates for the repositories maintained by
the Charm Tech team.

This repository is the canonical home for the things our repos have in common.
Rather than copy-pasting (and slowly diverging) the same style guides, security
policies, and CI config across every repo, we keep the source of truth here and
either link to it or copy from it.

## Contents

### Decisions

- [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) — a running log of team decisions.

### Style guides

Our style guides reflect team decisions, and we add to them as things come up in
code review.

- [STYLE.md](./STYLE.md) — documentation and docstring style (language-agnostic:
  British English, abbreviations, how to write great docs).
- [python/STYLE.md](./python/STYLE.md) — Python code style.
- [go/STYLE.md](./go/STYLE.md) — Go code style.

Other repos should link to these rather than maintaining their own copies. For
example, an `AGENTS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` can point at
`https://github.com/canonical/charm-tech/blob/main/STYLE.md`.

### Python project config

Canonical snippets to copy into a Python project, so that lint/format/type-check
behave consistently across repos:

- [python/pyproject-snippets.toml](./python/pyproject-snippets.toml) — `ruff`,
  `codespell`, `pyright`, and `coverage` config.
- [python/tox-template.ini](./python/tox-template.ini) — standard `lint`,
  `format`, `static`, and `unit` environments.

### Templates

Files to copy into a repo and lightly customise (replace `{{REPO}}` etc.):

- [templates/SECURITY.md](./templates/SECURITY.md)
- [templates/CONTRIBUTING.md](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [templates/AGENTS.md](./templates/AGENTS.md)
- [templates/dependabot-python-uv.yaml](./templates/dependabot-python-uv.yaml)
- [templates/dependabot-go.yaml](./templates/dependabot-go.yaml)
- [templates/pre-commit-config.yaml](./templates/pre-commit-config.yaml)
- [templates/claude-settings.json](./templates/claude-settings.json)
- [templates/zizmor-caller.yaml](./templates/zizmor-caller.yaml) — caller for the
  reusable zizmor workflow below.

### Reusable CI

- [.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml](./.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml) — a reusable
  workflow that runs the [zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor) GitHub
  Actions security scanner and uploads SARIF results.

Call it from another repo with a thin caller workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/zizmor.yaml in the consuming repo
name: Workflow static checks
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]
permissions: {}
jobs:
  zizmor:
    uses: canonical/charm-tech/.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml@<commit-sha>
    permissions:
      security-events: write
```

Pin to a commit SHA (not `@main`) so a change here can't silently alter another
repo's CI. See [templates/zizmor-caller.yaml](./templates/zizmor-caller.yaml)
for a ready-to-copy caller.
